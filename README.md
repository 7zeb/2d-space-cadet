# 2d-space-cadet
A 2D Web Version of the classic 3D Space Cadet Pinball coded iin p5.js!

## Currently in Development
The Github Repo will get slower updates since I'm using CodeHS as my IDE to see my p5 changes real-time, the commit messages will indicate what was changed since the last edit, if there is too many changes to say, it will say "refer to (version_number)"

## How to play
Since this project is currently in testing phase, the website hasn't been setup, to modify the p5.js code you will need a IDE (for example: Processing or CodeHS's onlne p5.js IDE), if you try to run the .js file, it WILL give you an error.
